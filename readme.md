 **Identification Application Specs** 

 Objective: Create an identification application that can take a picture of either a plant or animal and tell you what it is.


### Features

1. Small machine learning model that can process images offline and be able to stored on the device. The model would be a fine tuned model based on a pre-trained model and trained on Kaggle dataset of plants and animals. 

2. Capable of taking pictures. 

3. Capable of giving a list of what the model thinks the image is.

4. Handle cases where the model is not sure what the image is.


## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to take a picture of a plant or animal so that I can identify it.

2. As a user, I want to be able to see a list of what the model thinks the image is so that I can verify if it is correct.

3. As a user, I want to be able to take more pictures or another picture if the model is not sure what the image is so that I can get a more accurate identification.

## Sprints 

[x] Sprint 1: Set up the project specifications, build the camera screen
   
[] Sprint 2: identify machine learning model, research core ml and converting model from pytorch to core ml.  
    
[] Sprint 3: Build and refine camera screen and detail processing screen.
   
[] Sprint 4: Implement machine learning model and image processing.
    
[] Sprint 5: Test and refine application. Add more refined views. If time allows, incorporate more ar functionality.
