Ideas: 

1. **Identification Application**

- Create an identification application that can take a picture of either a plant or 
animal and tell you what it is. 

- The application would be multiered and would have a small machine learning model 
so that it can work offline. 

- The application would have multiple capabilities: it would be able to take pictures 
and then give you a list of what the model think it is and if it is not sure, it would ask you to take more pictures or another picture. 


2. **Language Learning Application**

- Create a language learning application that can help you learn a new language.

- The application would have multiple capabilities: it would be able to generate daily lessons, quizzes, and flashcards.

- The application would also have a chatbot that can help you practice your language skills.


3. **Mental Health Application**

- Create a mental health application that can help you track your mental health.

- The application would have multiple capabilities: it would be able to track your mood, sleep, and exercise.

- The application would also have a journaling feature that can help you track your thoughts and feelings.
